## Development Plan for VidKitSimple Application (Module-Based Development)

### Phase 1: Project Setup and CI/CD Environment
1. **Set up project infrastructure:**
   - Create the folder structure as proposed in the architecture document.
   - Configure the CMakeLists.txt file for the backend (Rust, Tauri) and frontend (React, TypeScript, SCSS, PrimeReact).
2. **Set up the development environment:**
   - Configure Docker to ensure a consistent environment across machines.
   - Set up a CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to build and run automated tests after each commit.
3. **Build and test a “Hello World” sample application:**
   - Set up basic Tauri commands to ensure the frontend and backend connection works.

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Development
1. **Build basic components:**
   - **VidKitApp & MainWindow:** Create the main application framework and initialize the main interface with empty tabs.
   - **GPUDetector:** Develop the GPU detection module and perform simple tests with log results.
   - **PresetManager:** Build the preset management module (save/read JSON files) with unit tests for I/O operations.
   - **VideoProcessor:** Set up the video processing module with basic FFmpeg integration (can run with sample commands).
2. **Test each module individually:**
   - Ensure each module has its own test cases and can run independently.
   - Integrate the modules into a sample application to test basic interactions via Tauri commands.

### Phase 3: Develop and Test Convert Video Functionality
1. **Develop Convert interface:**
   - Build ConvertView on the frontend with drag-and-drop file functionality and parameter configuration.
2. **Build ConvertController:**
   - Handle events from ConvertView and send data to the backend.
3. **Update VideoProcessor:**
   - Implement video conversion logic using FFmpeg, integrating GPU acceleration if available.
4. **Integration testing:**
   - After completing Convert, test it directly from the interface to ensure functionality works correctly.
   - Write automated tests and perform manual checks to validate outputs.

---

### Phase 4: Develop and Test Split Video Functionality
1. **Develop Split interface:**
   - Build SplitView with a timeline preview and options to split videos by time/size.
2. **Build SplitController:**
   - Handle video splitting logic and call the corresponding VideoProcessor functions.
3. **Update VideoProcessor:**
   - Add video splitting features, ensuring support for large files.
4. **Integration testing:**
   - Test the Split functionality immediately after building to verify video splitting and preview results.
   - Write unit tests and perform manual checks.

---

### Phase 5: Develop and Test Edit Video Functionality
1. **Develop Edit interface:**
   - Build EditView with a timeline interface for trimming, merging, and rotating videos.
2. **Build EditController:**
   - Handle editing actions from the interface and interact with VideoProcessor.
3. **Update VideoProcessor:**
   - Implement video editing logic (trim, merge, rotate) using FFmpeg.
4. **Integration testing:**
   - After building, test the Edit functionality to ensure video editing operations are accurate.
   - Integrate automated tests for basic operations.

---

### Phase 6: Develop and Test Sanitize Video Functionality
1. **Develop Sanitize interface:**
   - Build SanitizeView with checkboxes for removing metadata, watermarks, and generating reports.
2. **Build SanitizeController:**
   - Handle video sanitization logic and pass parameters to VideoProcessor.
3. **Update VideoProcessor:**
   - Add logic to remove unwanted information from videos via FFmpeg.
4. **Integration testing:**
   - Test the Sanitize functionality after completion to ensure videos are processed correctly.
   - Write automated tests for sanitize scenarios.

---

### Phase 7: Integration, Optimization, and System Testing
1. **Integrate functionalities:**
   - Combine Convert, Split, Edit, and Sanitize modules into a complete application.
2. **Optimize performance:**
   - Optimize multithreading using QThread/QtConcurrent or Rust’s async APIs.
   - Improve memory management for large file processing.
3. **System testing:**
   - Perform integration testing between the frontend and backend.
   - Ensure the interface displays correctly, processes accurately, and communicates via Tauri commands.
   - Write comprehensive automated tests for each functionality and the entire system.

---

### Phase 8: Packaging and Deployment
1. **Package the application:**
   - Create installers for Windows and Linux, or portable packages if needed.
2. **Write user documentation:**
   - Update release notes and provide installation and usage guides.
3. **Prepare for deployment:**
   - Ensure automated tests run through CI/CD, ready for release.
